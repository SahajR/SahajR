I'm a mobile focused full-stack developer from Bengaluru, India.

- I've developed both frontend (React.js) and backend (Node.js) mostly in __javaScript__, and it is my favourite language to use.
- I'm an experienced android developer coding in __Kotlin__ and leveraging **M**odern **A**ndroid **D**evelopment methodologies (#MAD skills in short, as they say :D)
- I currently work as a founding engineer on [voice AI](https://cozmox.ai) and have shifted focus to scaling infrastructure and platform engineering
