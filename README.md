I'm a mobile focused full-stack developer from Bengaluru, India.

- I've developed both frontend (React.js) and backend (Node.js) mostly in __javaScript__, and it is my favourite language to use.
- I'm an experienced android developer coding in __Kotlin__ and leveraging **M**odern **A**ndroid **D**evelopment methodologies (#MAD skills in short, as they say :D)
- I know basic __Python__ for scripting use cases, like scrapping websites
- I love the current ecosystem of deploying services to the cloud, so I love working in __Golang__ to extend the core functionality of Kubernetes
- With WASM being introduced, I'd love to build performant modules to work on the browser, so I'm currently learning __Rust__
